<p>Bulle, Tartine, Momo and other characters of the <b>Mon Ami Bulle</b> app, travel and make discoveries in unique universes. This project was contract work for the IOS app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/mon-ami-bulle/id1088076963?mt=8" target="_blank">Mon ami Bulle</a> by Télé Québec.</p>

<p>I worked on many assets for the animated sequences, and did the artwork for 3 of the main narrated stories of the game. The stories were my main task. The project was published in 2016, I worked on the project in 2015.</p>

<p>It was a really lovely project, made with love by an amazing team, but I fear that this format will mean that Mon Ami Bulle will succumb to bit rot. I hope I am wrong.</p>
