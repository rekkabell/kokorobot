<h3>2024</h3>

<p>The year began with the completion of the re-upholstering of all of the cushions on our boat. I first embarked on this ambitious endeavour in November, but because Pino houses a total of 18 cushions it took me a long time to finish. Some shapes were trickier than others, I learned a lot.</p>

<p>Then that same month, I made the decision to stop drinking, and haven't had a drop since. I've been meaning to stop for a long time, but my hereditary rosacea(thanks dad) finally kicked in and forced my hand. Everytime I would have a drink, even a 4% beer, my face would begin to redden, and to burn. I developed the same reaction to large amounts of ginger, really spicy foods, and lapsang souchong. I've since cut most of these things out of my diet, and so far my symptoms have remained manageable.<br>There are now plenty of NA drinks around, so I do not feel left out on social outings, although I have noticed that I am less tolerant of people who overdrink. Being sober with very drunk people is just terrible. In all, I am glad that I stopped and I hope that the steps I've taken will limit future flareups.</p>

<p>This year I worked on comics for {Hakum} a lot in my spare time. I decided to allot weeknights to drawing comics, reserving time to do it has kept me happy this year. I really love drawing with pencils, I love having a limited toolset.</p>

<p>This year I moved my domains away from Netfirms and transferred them to a new registrar, WHC. Netfirms has been terrible for a long, long time, but transfering seemed like such a hastle that I never spent the time to do it. What prompted the move this time was that they began harassing me to buy new domains, adding them temporarily to my account and requiring me talk to an agent to take it off. Their UI has gone from ok to garbage, it was time to move house. I enjoy WHC so far, but unfortunately, like many companies they too have decided that a UI re-design with unnecessary smooth transitions and rounded corners was necessary(fuck).</p>

<p>This year I found it harder to find good information out there(fuck you ai). While doing general research, I often landed on webpages that were hosting erroneous generated content. It was very frustating:<br>
<p><i>A site about how to fill a pillow looks legit at first, then lapses into how to make filling for food.
A site about boating uses fake people to write articles about boating, talking about how to make trips they've never done or never plan to do (obvious from the writing).</i><br>It is gonna get harder and harder to find good information out there. Built myself an extended list of {bookmarks}</p>

<p>On April 22nd, Andrea, a friend, fellow sailor, and marina neighbor, passed away. Andrea was an excellent watercolor artist, specializing in dreamy scenery of the B.C. coast. We spent many afternoons on the dock, sharing stories, drinks in hand. Andrea was modest, soft-spoken and kind, she would always leave room for you in a conversation — a rare trait. For a long while, there was a dark cloud hanging over the docks. Jim, her partner, gave us a graphic novel called Va’a: Virée aux Tuamotu by Benjamin Flao et Troubs, belonging to Andrea. Now, we carry a part of her with us wherever we sail.</p>

<p>Then in early May, we set sail for Southeast Alaska. I've described the trip at length </p>
