<q>Approximate answers are often good enough, even if technically wrong.</q>

<p>"Good Enough Arithmetics" permits us to estimate the answer to basic arithmetic equations in our heads with reasonable accuracy, without using a pencil and paper.</p>

<h2>Temperature conversions</h2>

<p>Say you are a Canadian visiting the United States and are unfamiliar with temperature readings in Fahrenheit, how do you convert it back to Celsius to know if you ought to wear a sweater?</p>

<p>The equation to make the conversion is rather complex to do in the head...</p>

<pre>
°C > °F   multiply by 9/5 and add 32.
°F > °C   subtract 32 and multiply by 5/9
</pre>

<p>Examples</p>
<p>What is 25 Celsius in Farenheit?</p>
<pre>
25 x 9 / 5 + 32 = 77 °F
</pre>
<p>What is 56 Fahrenheit in Celsius?</p>
<pre>
56 - 32 x 5 / 9 = 13.3 °C
</pre>

<p>As stated above, the above formula is very complex. For most purposes, anything within 5 °F of the real value works. To do a simple conversion without a calculator using the following simplified formula:</p>

<pre>
°F > °C   subtract 30 and divide by 2</pre>

<p>An example:</p>

<pre>
What is 65°F in Celsius?

(65-30)/2= 17.5 °C 
</pre>

<h2>Multiplying Big Numbers</h2>

<p>Most people cannot multiply big numbers in their heads. Like when estimating temperature, estimating the answer by rounding up(or down) number is good enough for most purposes.</p>

<p>Say you want to multiply 54 x 302, change 54 to 50 and 302 to 300.</p>

<pre>
50 x 300 = 15000
 5 x 3   = 15, then add back the tree zeros
</pre>

<p>The accurate answer is 16,308. The above estimate is 14% too large, but as previously stated, that is often good enough. In the above equation, I changed 54 to 50, removing 4. To get a more precise result, take 15000 and add 4x300 to the answer:</p>

<pre>
Simplify using smaller numbers: 4 x 3 = 12
Add back the two zeros to make a total of 1200
15000 + 1200 = 16,200
</pre>

<p>The above is now way more precise, without being 100% accurate. If you rounded the numbers up instead of down, substract instead.</p>

<p>When precision and accuracy are desired, <b>use a calculator</b>.</p>
