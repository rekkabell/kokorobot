<p>Incredible Death screensaver, done as part of <a href="https://itch.io/jam/screensaverjam" target="_blank">Screensaver jam 2016</a>.</p>

<p>This was a project about <a href="https://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/death-positive-movement/" target="_blank">Death Positivity</a>, inspired by Caitlin Doughty, a mortician, writer, and advocate for funeral industry reform.</p>

<p>In this screensaver, Death, a floating face surrounded by stars, was supposed to share comforting phrases about dying pulled at random from a database I had written, but I couldn't figure that part out in time. The final project featured Death appearing, as if summoned, and sticking around, keeping you company. It was my first time using Unity for a project.</p>

<p>The white faced Death character was inspired by the representation of Death in Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal(1957).</p>
