<h3>Meds</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. Hakazi has been on his own for a while in Montore after leaving the Solo Devs(yet again), following a fight with Ikkard and Kaddali. His symptoms are getting worse, he can no longer control his outbursts. To try and limit the damage he causes, he visits a clinic in Montore (owned by Jak and Nemerald) to try and get some meds.</p>

<p>This comic is forever unfinished, I kept some of the rough pages in the end for the hell of it :>...</p>

<p>Jak's second language is m√†koua(French dialect), this explains why he doesn't pronounce certain words correctly (dis, dat instead this, that). He doesn't pronounces "H" or "TH" sounds. It was a bit difficult to contrast this to Hakazi's dysarthria, but I did my best lol...</p>
