<p>I designed assets for Niju, a little application by {hundredrabbits} to review the Japanese hiragana and katakana alphabets, compatible with the {Uxn} system. It has two study modes.</p>

<p>As you progress through the game, you accumulate different types of leaves on the branch. When the branch is complete, you have mastered the alphabet!</p>

<p>It was first released on iOS years ago. It then became Alphavetist when we introduced more languages, like Hebrew, Cyrillic, Korean, Inuktitut, Greek and Morse.</p>

<p>Niju published in August 2021, it was a trial project to see if {Devine} and & could design, write and assemble a project entirely within the <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> computer. We also made it to practice using <a href='https://100r.ca/site/nasu' target='_blank'>Nasu</a>, our spritesheet editor.</p>
