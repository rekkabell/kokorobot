<q>Approximate answers are often good enough, even if technically wrong.</q>

<p>"Good Enough Arithmetics," coined by Don Norman, permits us to estimate the answer to basic arithmetic equations in our heads with reasonable accuracy, without using a calculator or a pencil and paper.</p>

<h2>Temperature conversions</h2>

<p>Say you are a Canadian traveler in the United States and are unfamiliar with temperature readings in fahrenheit, how do you convert it back to celsius to know if you ought to wear a sweater?</p>

<p>The below equations to make the conversions from °F >°C and °C >°F, are difficult to do in one's head...</p>

<pre>
°C > °F   multiply by 9/5 and add 32.
°F > °C   subtract 32 and multiply by 5/9
</pre>

<p>Examples:</p>
<p>What is 25 celsius in farenheit?</p>
<pre>
25 x ( 9 / 5 ) + 32 = 77 °F
</pre>
<p>What is 56 fahrenheit in celsius?</p>
<pre>
56 - ( 32 x 5 ) / 9 = 13.3 °C
</pre>

<p>As stated before, the above formulas are difficult. For most purposes, anything within 5 °F of the real value works. To do a simple conversion without a calculator, use the following simplified formula:</p>

<pre>
(°F - 30) / 2 = °C
Subtract 30 and divide by 2</pre>
<p>An example:</p>

<pre>
What is 65°F in Celsius?      .._     _..
                             / | \\_// | \
(65 - 30) / 2 = 17.5 °C     /*/|*.*.*.*|\*\
                            |_||x-x-x-x||_|
                            '''|_______|'''
                               '''''''''
                           Sweater? Yes? No?
</pre> 

<p>For the above example, the accurate temperature conversion from fahrenheit is 18.3 °C. Close enough. I won't need to bring a sweater.</p>

<h2>Multiplying Big Numbers</h2>

<p>Most people cannot multiply big numbers in their heads quickly. Like when estimating temperature, estimating the answer by rounding a number up(or down) is good enough for most purposes.</p>

<p>Say you want to multiply 54 x 302, change <b>54 to 50</b> and <b>302 to 300</b>.</p>

<pre>
50 x 300 = 15000
 5 x 3   = 15, then add back the 3 zeros
</pre>

<p>The accurate answer is 16,308. The above estimate is a bit too low, but as previously stated, that is often good enough. In the above equation, I changed 54 to 50, removing 4. To get a more precise result, take 15000 and add back 4 x 300 to the answer:</p>

<pre>  
                          *         *      *  *
    *                                  *     *  /\
                *              *        * *    / /
4 x 300 becomes 4 x 3              * .___*___./_/
                                    |  _   _  |
The result is 12.         *        [| ^  |  ^ |]
Add back the 2 zeros to make 1200.   \___-___/
15000 + 1200 = 16,200               _(|| | ||)_ 
                                   /.|.......|.\  
</pre>                                            

<p>The above is now way more precise, without being 100% accurate. If rounding the numbers up instead of down, substract instead.</p>

<p>In short, to get good enough answers:<br><b>+ Round numbers up, or down<br>+ Simplify equations using smaller numbers<br>+ Add back the zeros</b></p>

<p>When precision and accuracy are desired, <b>use a calculator</b>.</p>

<h2>Good Enough Measurements</h2>

<p>When you want to take quick measurements without the need for precision, consider measuring different parts of your hand and using that as a measuring device. Memorizing 5 numbers ought not to be too difficult.</p>

<p>Your hand goes with you wherever you go, while you may forget to take a ruler or measuring tape with you.</p>

<pre>
    3-finger span
    <----------->          
         ___                 Forefinger   _
     ___||_||___              length    /'|
    ||_||   ||_||           <---------->|  \   
    |   |   |   |             _________ /   `\
    |   | ~ |   |___        (__'__'__. |      |_ 
    | ~ |   | ~ ||_||           |____)  \     .

|   / "   "   "     \      Hand       Span

|  |<--------------->|     <---|-|-|-|--->
|  .     Palm span   |     _   | | | | /`)
|                   .|     \'\ | | | |/ /
 \      Wrist      ./       \ \|" " " "/
   \.    span    ../         |         |
    |<----------->|           \       /
    |            .)            \      | 
</pre>

<p>Measure the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Hand Span</b>. Outstretch your hand, measure the distance between the tip of your little finger to the tip of your thumb.</li>
	<li><b>Palm Span</b>. Measure the width of your hand, from the base of the thumb(w/o the width of the thumb) to straight across, to the outer edge of the palm.</li>
	<li><b>Forefinger Length</b>. Measure the length of your forefinger.</li>
	<li><b>Wrist Span</b>. Measure the span of your wrist above the wrist bone, just before the hand begins.</li>
	<li><b>3-Finger Span</b>. Put your fingers together, measure the width of the 3 middle fingers together.</li>
</ul>
