<q>Approximate answers are often good enough, even if technically wrong.</q>
<cite>Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things</cite>

<p>"Good Enough Arithmetics" permits us to estimate the answer to basic arithmetic equations in our heads with reasonable accuracy, without using a pencil and paper.</p>

<h2>Temperature conversions</h2>

<p>Say you are a Canadian visiting the United States and are unfamiliar with temperature readings in Fahrenheit, how do you convert it back to Celsius to know if you ought to wear a sweater?</p>

<p>The equation to make the conversion is rather complex to do in the head...</p>

<pre>
°C > °F   multiply by 9/5 and add 32.
°F > °C   subtract 32 and multiply by 5/9
</pre>

<p>Examples:</p>
<p>What is 25 Celsius in Farenheit?</p>
<pre>
25 x 9 / 5 + 32 = 77 °F
</pre>
<p>What is 56 Fahrenheit in Celsius?</p>
<pre>
56 - 32 x 5 / 9 = 13.3 °C
</pre>

<p>As stated before, the above formulas are very complex. For most purposes, anything within 5 °F of the real value works. To do a simple conversion without a calculator using the following simplified formula:</p>

<pre>
(°F-30)/2 = °C
Subtract 30 and divide by 2</pre>
<p>An example:</p>

<pre>
What is 65°F in Celsius?

(65-30)/2= 17.5 °C 
</pre>

<p>For the above example, the accurate temperature conversion from fahrenheit is 18.3 °C. Close enough, I won't need to bring a sweater.</p>

<h2>Multiplying Big Numbers</h2>

<p>Most people cannot multiply big numbers in their heads quickly. Like when estimating temperature, estimating the answer by a number up(or down) is good enough for most purposes.</p>

<p>Say you want to multiply 54 x 302, change 54 to 50 and 302 to 300.</p>

<pre>
50 x 300 = 15000
 5 x 3   = 15, then add back the 3 zeros
</pre>

<p>The accurate answer is 16,308. The above estimate is a bit too large, but as previously stated, that is often good enough. In the above equation, I changed 54 to 50, removing 4. To get a more precise result, take 15000 and add back 4x300 to the answer:</p>

<pre>
4 x 300 becomes 4 x 3

The result is 12, add back the 2 zeros to make 1200.

15000 + 1200 = 16,200
</pre>

<p>The above is now way more precise, without being 100% accurate. If you rounded the numbers up instead of down, substract instead.</p>

<p>In short, to get good enough answers:<br><b>+ Round numbers up or down<br>+ Simplify equations using smaller numbers<br>+ Add back the zeros</b></p>

<h2>Good Enough Measurements</h2>

<p>When you require to calculate quick measurements without the need for precision, consider measuring different parts of your hand and using that as a measuring device.</p>

<p>Measure the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Hand Span</b>. Outstretch your hand, measure the distance between the tip of your little finger to the end of your thumb.</li>
	<li><b>Palm Span</b>. Measure the width of your hand, from the line where the thumb begins in a straight line to the other side.</li>
	<li><b>Forefinger Length</b>. Measure the length of your forefinger.</li>
	<li><b>Wrist Span</b>. Measure the span of your wrist above the wrist bone, just before the hand begins.</li>
	<li><b>3-Finger Span</b>. Put your fingers together, measure the width of the 3 middle fingers together.</li>
</ul>
