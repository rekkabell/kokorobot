<h2>2025-10-28 Cozy.</h2>

<p>The boat is back on the Victoria docks, and Devine & I are visiting our families out east. We spend our days preparing meals for more mouths than we are used to, having long conversations over warm drinks, talking long walks with short pauses at the local calisthenics park, and working inbetween it all. HundredRabbits is a juror for the <a href="https://rhizome.org" target="_blank">Rhizome</a> media arts 2025 Microgrants, and so we have been busy reading through hundreds of applications. It is enlightening to be on the other side of this process.</p>

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. I can do about 5 pull-ups right now, but still only 1 from a fully extended position. I can do 6 when I have a horizontal grip on the halyards setup on Pino's bow. The ropes being a 1/2 inch thick makes for good grip, I don't have this kid of grip strength from a horizontal bar, especially if I have to stand on my tippy toes to reach it.<br>I'd love to get into kickboxing, to find an affordable class that I can participate in for the winter, but they are expensive. I know I can train outside of that context, but I'd really like an activity that involves other people. I spent a lot of time on my own, I really need to move and to get out of my own head.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I am up to 55 drawings for {punk rabbits}. It is obvious now that I will not finish in time for the Hundred Rabbits studio anniversay in November — an overly-ambitious goal. I've added a few sketches of Hakazi and Dae in {sketchbook}(see topmost entries). I used to draw Dae as a skinny guy, but it really doesn't fit the activity level of his character. I redrew him to have the <a href="../media/content/sketch/dae_full.jpg" target="_blank">build of a climber</a>. I haven't had a lot of time to make comics, I am sad about this and hope I find the time to complete more pages over the winter.<br>I am continuing work on the upcoming Playdate version of Donsol, drawing and animating sprites. Progress is good.</p>

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I am currently reading through classics. I read through The Outsiders, all in the same day while traveling to visit my parents. The author, Susan E. Hinton, wrote it when she was 15 year old and it was published a year later. It is a good read, with good complex characters and a lot of heart. I finished reading it with plans to continue to watch many more sunsets. I have now begun to read Madame Bovary, another classic, but it is too early to say much about it.<br>Aside from my solo-reading, I continue to read Middlemarch aloud to Devine.</p>

<p><b>MOVIE</b>. Like everyone else in the English speaking world I have partaken in soda pop and was subsequently engulfed in the craze that is Kpop Demon Hunters. The premise of demons taking over the world by creating a Korean boy band is completely irresistible. I loved every bit of it. The music is well-produced, the characters are fun, the animation/expressions is just... crazy, and the story, while having a few plot holes, holds itself well. I've been listening to the soundtrack on repeat, it is addictive. I wholeheartedly believe that if demons existed and employed that same strategy to conquer us that we would all be fucked.<br>Been watching a lot of good horror movies lately, like The Substance, Weapons, and Together. Both The Substance and Together feature body-horror that serve the plot well(it isn't gratuitous). The Substance is horror satire, and just visually stunning, while Together is also kind of absurdist, horror/romance(a rare, but fantastic mix). Weapons features Amy Madigan(Uncle Buck), and she is just fantastic in this film. I enjoyed the format of the movie, split in parts following the same story through different characters. While being a horror film, there is a bit of humor squeezed in there which balances out the story well. It it amazing to see so many good recent horror films.</p>
