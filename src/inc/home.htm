<h2>2025-10-28 Cozy.</h2>

<p>The boat is back on the Victoria docks, and Devine & I are visiting our families out east. We spend our days preparing meals for more mouths than we are used to, having long conversations over warm drinks, talking long walks with short pauses at the local calisthenics park, and working inbetween it all. HundredRabbits is a juror for the <a href="https://rhizome.org" target="_blank">Rhizome</a> media arts 2025 Microgrants, and so we have been busy reading through hundreds of applications. It is enlightening to be on the other side of this process.</p>

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. I have been cycling a lot more this month, despite the persistent rain and cold. The city of Victoria has added many more protected cycling paths, making getting around the city safer, and easier. </p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I have drawn 63 rabbits for {punk rabbits}.</p>

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I am currently reading through classics. I read through The Outsiders, all in the same day while traveling to visit my parents. The author, Susan E. Hinton, wrote it when she was 15 year old and it was published a year later. It is a good read, with good complex characters and a lot of heart. I finished reading it with plans to continue to watch many more sunsets. I have now begun to read Madame Bovary, another classic, but it is too early to say much about it.<br>Aside from my solo-reading, I continue to read Middlemarch aloud to Devine.</p>

<p><b>MOVIE</b>. I've been watching a lot of older films, like Lawrence of Arabia, Casablanca, and, a favorite of when I was a kid, The Long Long Trailer.</p>
