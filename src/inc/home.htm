<h2>2025-01-02 Fun with family</h2>

<p>Dev & I have spent the last month visiting family. Much of the temperature this month was below zero, but we were well-dressed and drank lots and lots of tea. I cooked a ton. I made pies, tourtières, cookies, pizzas, breads, lasagnas, etc. Cooking for others is usually a stressful affair for me, but I do not experience this with family. I really love sharing meals with my parents, when I leave I will miss this.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I released a new {rabbit waves} page about <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/aircraft.html" target="_blank">Ground to Air Communication</a>.</p> 

<p><b>MOVIES</b>. We watched Alien: Romulus the other day. I am a big fan of the first Alien film (only that one). Alien: Covenant was so terrible, so full of gratuitous violence, that I was a bit concerned, I was not eager to have to sit through something like that again, but I remembered Lizbeth mentioning that it was very good, so we gave it a watch. It was excellent. I really loved David Jonsson's portrayal of a synthetic. The horror was well balanced, and the use of analog effects was so worth it — loved the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WbiYdqXjtQ" target="_blank">facehugger animatronics</a>(YouTube). I did not love that they <i>revived</i> Ian Holm for this film, the effect was not well done.<br>I also watched Vampire Humaniste Cherche Suicidaire Consentant, a vampire film produced in Quebec about a teenage vampire who refuses to kill to eat, and so searches for someone who consents to die. I loved this film.<br>Another notable film that I watched this month was Nope by Jordan Peele. I really loved it, it's a good cautionary tale, and to me was reminiscent of the book Le Péril Bleu by Maurice Renard.</p>

<p><b>MUSIC</b>. I was introduced to <a href="https://lustsickpuppy.bandcamp.com/album/carousel-from-hell" target="_blank">Carousel From Hell</a> by Lust$ickPuppy, it is excellent.</p>

<p><b>QUOTES</b><q>Imagination is more important than knowledge, for knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.</q><cite>A quote by Albert Einstein</cite></p>

<p><b>CALL TO ACTION</b>. After being wrongly incarcerated for 5 months, Paul Watson, an activist, was <a href="https://www.paulwatsonfoundation.org/anti-whaling-activist-paul-watson-free-denmark-dismisses-japan-extradition-request/" target="_blank">released from prison</a> in Greenland!</p>
