<h2>2026-01-29 Tempest in a Teacup</h2>

<p>Most of December was very rainy, and stormy. I don't mind getting wet usually, but I draw the line at hail and torrential rain. January has been much nicer, but cold. I wrote my <a href="../site/2025dec31.html">yearly review</a>, and made a few changes to this website. I moved {books for children} to {stories}, and re-worked the layout for {projects}, {games}, {notes} and {how-to} — now all of the pages have images representing them.<br>My mind has felt cluttered of late, in part because I've accepted too many projects and was struggling to see past them. I am grateful for the extra work though, because Dev & I are having a new headsail made for {Pino} and it is not a cheap affair. I've also made a few clumsy mistakes lately that have weighed on me, unrelated to my art or projects, which I deeply regret. I sometimes forget that the clutter is only inside of me, that it is not visible to others, that it involves no one else, and that life is actually really calm, beautiful and organized out there.</p>

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. Devine & I picked up some old wooden tennis racquets at a local thrift store to play squash with. Yes, we know that it is not the right type of racquet to play this sport and people at the gym keep telling us so, but it is difficult to find good secondhand squash rackets. Playing with them is fine, but because they are heavier we need to swing harder. I've really enjoyed playing, we try and go twice a week.<br>While in Ucluelet a few days ago, we met up with Tamara who has invited us to climbing. I've always wanted to try it, but never got the chance. I look forward to it. She also suggested surfing on the west coast of Van Island, but I fear that I will lose my fingers (I have Raynauld's Syndrome).</p>

<p><b>TRAVEL</b>. As I mentioned, I went to Ucluelet for 3 days with Devine and PVH by car. On the ride there, we stopped by Port Alberni, and in Coombs on the way back(although Goats on the Roof was closed for the season). We also stopped at a store selling dutch candy. I don't like candy much, but I do like salty licorice(salmiakki) and brought some back home. Only I will eat it because Devine hates it. While in Ucluelet, we stayed at The Black Rock Resort, a very nice hotel, courtesy of our friend Avi(thank you). We attended meetings as advisors for the conception of the upcoming <a href="https://www.risingtideboatworks.com/" target="_blank">Rising Tide Boatworks</a> boatyard project. We visited the site, and went for a ride aboard a 42-foot whale watching boat that will soon be converted to electric. The project is coming along nicely, the site is much cleaner than it was, and the main hangar has been hollowed out.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I completed the {punk rabbits} drawing series, ending it with 102 rabbits. Woohoo! I improved my hand a lot while doing this series, I may continue to draw some rabbits casually, but I won't keep count.<br>I made a simple <a href="../site/pics.html">image feed</a> so I could show recent art and photos I've made, it's possible to follow updates via RSS. I've been adding {goblins} for Goblin Week 2026(still in progress).</p>

<p><b>SEWING</b>. After reading Make, Sew and Mend by Bernadette Banner, Devine & I decided to take our old hats apart to use them as patterns, and to try and remake them again ourselves. We went to pick up 12oz black canvas at a local fabrics store, as well as some double-sided tape. The work went well, and I am very pleased with the result. See <a href="../site/sewing.html#hat">sewing</a> for more photos and details.</p>

<p><b>MOVIE</b>. I went to see One Battle After Another at the local Imax theater. I really enjoyed this film, it is rare to watch a film in which the main character, the supposed male hero, efumbles ceaselessly, and only succeeds because of the help of others(who operate in the shadows for the well-being of people, not because they want to be thanked). I look forward to seeing it again.</p>

<q>Hobbies are really important in developing our sense of self, our sense of agency, to knowing that we can learn new skills, and learning that we can practice something and be consistent.</q>

<p><b>CALL FOR ACTION</b>. <a href="https://www.al3f.com/" target="_blank">Aleph</a>, a good friend, is currently <a href="https://merveilles.town/@aleph/115968750034893648" target="_blank">looking for work</a>(looking for a full-time or contract work in SRE / DevOps / IT Operations, contact them if you know of any openings), but until they secure a job they need help to cover essential living costs for February. If you can <a href="https://ko-fi.com/aleph0x" target="_blank">spare a few dollars</a> it'd be great! Another good friend, Cathos, is also <a href="https://ko-fi.com/cathos" target="_blank">looking for support</a>, throw some love her way.</p>
