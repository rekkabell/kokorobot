<h2>2025-12-05 Athumb athump.</h2>

<p>It is getting cold, and I am having a hard time getting used to the sun setting earlier, to counter this Devine & I have put up Christmas lights inside the boat. We managed to find 2 matching strings, thrifted locally. These have greatly improved my mood aboard. I've also been tackling much-needed repairs aboard Pino, like taking the <a href="../media/content/stream/waterpump.jpg">water pump</a> apart(i think this is how i may have hurt my thumb), and stripping, sanding, and re-varnishing the cover of my boat's <a href="../media/content/stream/drytoilet.jpg">dry toilet</a>.</p>

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. I have been cycling a lot more this month, despite the persistent rain and cold. The city of Victoria has added many more protected cycling paths, making getting around the city safer, and easier. I really miss being obligated to cycle everyday, rain or shine. As it stands, I only cycle when I need to go get something somewhere, like a grocery run, or going to pick up a part at a faraway store. I need to create more opportunities for cycling.<br>I somehow hurt the thumb of my left hand recently, which happens to be my dominant hand, and it is hard to basic things, like working scissors or using my pen tablet pen. I hope that the swelling goes down soon. I can still draw, but the little thumb splint I made for myself does hinder my movement a bit.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I have drawn 65 rabbits for {punk rabbits}. Aside from that, I have been drawing and animating sprites for {Donsol}. I finished drawing most of the monsters and am now working on animating the bosses. Devine is finally beginning to work on the game with me, we hope to release the game early next year.</p>

<p><b>SEWING</b>. I am trying to get better at sewing, whether it be by hand or with my machine. I hope to better my skills to one day be able to make repairs or projects for others. I completed 2 small projects, like a protective canvas sleeve for Devine's computer, and a <a href="../media/content/stream/pouch.jpg">pouch</a> to store a little <a href="../media/content/stream/steamiron.jpg">1980's foldable steam iron</a> I found at the thrift store.</p>

<p><b>MOVIE</b>. I've been watching a lot of older films lately, like Lawrence of Arabia, Casablanca, and, a favorite of when I was a kid, The Long Long Trailer. I've enjoyed them all.</p>

<q>Even outside of work, social media features such as likes, shares, and retweets play the role of points in games. Over time, these simple metrics threaten to distort or take the place of values (say, the wish to meaningfully contribute to discussion or to take pride in the quality of one’s work) that might otherwise have inflected our behavior on these platforms.</q>

<p><b>CALL FOR ACTION</b>. Currently, the fantastic Pattie Gonia is walking 100 miles in drag over a period of one week to raise funds forBIPOC + Queer 8 nonprofits & orgs working to make the outdoors/environmental spaces a more equitable place, and that is a really a crazy worthy cause. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-1m-dollar-backpacking-trip" target="_blank">Support the campaign</a> if you can.</p>
