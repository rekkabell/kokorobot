<h2>2024-08-05 Grey Days</h2>

<p>A month of upwind sailing, fog, and motoring painfully slowly over still waters, the way back south through northern Canada has not been easy. We had to do short hops between anchorages, and often had to stay for 2-3 days at each stop to wait for favorable weather to keep going. {Obi} has not seen much use, grey days, lack of solar power, make working on the computer difficult, so I've been drawing, mostly, and writing in my logbook.</p>

<p>I drew the cast of {Hakum}, when they're a bit <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/hakum_gang_1990.jpg" target="_blank">younger</a>, and then <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/hakum_gang_2000.jpg" target="_blank">older with some new members</a>. I also completed a very short vignette comic named <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/hakum_shoes.jpg" target="_blank">Shoes</a>, Dae spends all his time in the forest, never wears shoes, and never rode a bike before.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Devine & I have resumed work on {Markl}. We hope to publish it on the Playdate along with {Oquonie}. The Playdate has been a good source of entertainment for me while at anchor, I especially enjoyed the game Saturday Edition by Chris Makris.</p>
