<p>I have been using homemade reusable sanitary pads since 2016, and even if I live on a boat and don't always have access to a washing machine and dryer, it's all works out fine. A cup is a good reusable option for some people, but it's not something I'm comfortable with.</p>

<p><b>Design.</b> When first researching designs for my pads, I found all sorts of suggestions online, but in the end I chose a simple no-sew option. No-sew sanitary pads work by folding the fabric of pad over itself, for thicker flow days I add another towel inside for extra absorbency. I found square 100% cotton towels at a store, and bought a 100% cotton bathroom towel with plans to cut it down into squares that match the size of the other towels. How many pads you need depends on how heavy your flow is, and how long it typically lasts. The typically amount lies between 4 and 12, I use about 6 pads myself, but you may want more depending on what you're comfortable with.</p>

<p>I chose cotton because it is durable, affordable, easy to find, and absorbent.</p>

<p>To form my pads, I folded each towel about 4 times over itself, then placed it at the edge of the inside of a patterned cotton cloth and folded it in about 4 times... and that's really it. This results in 4 somewhat thick pad, but it suits me fine, and I don't add a towel inbetween the last cotton cloth so that I can use it for the end of my menstrual cycle. For less thickness, get narrow towels that will fold down to the same width but with less folds.</p>

<p>5 pads has worked well enough for me, but you may want more. Also, it is really worth sewing the edges of a square towel otherwise it will unravel. This design has no wings, but I chose this on purpose because I wear shorties. I just make sure to wear snug underwear so that it stays put.</p>

<p>When a pad is soiled, I throw it in a bucket of cold water along with some baking soda. The baking soda helps lift the blood out of the material and helps combat odors. I throw every new pad into the bucket as I use them, and rinse the water of the bucket everyday, adding more baking soda afterwards. When my period is over, I empty the bucket, rinse the pads with freshwater a few times, then add some laundry detergent and give them a good wash, rinsing afterwards. When I at anchor, I wash them by hand and let them air dry when the sun is out, but when near land I use a washing machine and dryer at a laundromat.</p>
