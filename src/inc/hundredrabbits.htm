<p><b>Hundred Rabbits</b> is a small artist collective. Together, we explore the planned failability of modern technology at the bounds of the hyper-connected world. We research and test low-tech solutions and document our findings with the hope of building a more resilient future.</p>

Living in remote uninhabited parts of the world has offered us a playground to learn how technology degrades beyond the shores of the western world.</p>

<p>Since 2016, we have sailed from Canada, the US West coast, down to Mexico, over to French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga, New Zealand, Fiji, The Marshall Islands, all the way to Japan and then back again to Canada :>.</p>
