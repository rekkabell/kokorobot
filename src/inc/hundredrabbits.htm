<p><b>Hundred Rabbits</b> is a small artist collective that formed in 2016, made up of my partner <a href="https://xxiivv.com" target="_blank">Devine</a> and myself. Together, we document low-tech solutions with the hope of building a more resilient future. We live and work aboard a 10 m sailboat named {Pino} in remote parts of the world to learn more about how technology degrades beyond the shores of the western world.</p>

We've adapted our software and projects around the limitations of our vessel instead of increasing its limits. We learned to appreciate these limits and think that they make our work better.</p>

<p>We want our work to be an equal blend of aesthetics, playfulness, and practicality. We aim to keep our software small, portable and build from first principles to keep them participatory.</p>

<p>The name Hundred Rabbits comes from the name of the sailboat in the animated show Ergo proxy, while the sailboat's name Pino comes from the android sailor aboard the sailboat from that same show.</p>

<p>Since 2016, we have sailed from Canada, the US West coast, down to Mexico, over to French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga, New Zealand, Fiji, The Marshall Islands, all the way to Japan and then back again to Canada. We then explored B.C's Northern Coast and went on to visit Southeast Alaska.</p>
