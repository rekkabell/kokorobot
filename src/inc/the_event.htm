<h3>The Event</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. Hakazi and Ikkard have been in Liskar together for 3 years, but now an event threatens their friendship and Hakazi isn't sure he can survive another big change...</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>. Hakazi has learned to enunciate again, but still has some difficulty. I tried to make this evident in the text, while keeping it readable. If you could hear him speak, he would speak slow.</p>

<p>I will add sequences that precede and follow this one soon.</p>

<p><b>Warning</b>. <i>Some swearing, death
.</i><br><b>[Status: complete]</b></p>
