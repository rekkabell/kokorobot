<h3>Production story</h3>

<p>The story of Wiktopher is an elaboration of a short film I did in 2008 called {Uno}. This project was supposed to expand into a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QTsnRfFGXChVb-9x1fYY0Jdj6wTL8C_n/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">comic</a>, which included many of the Wiktopher characters like Eka, Uno, Zukka, Lupen and Ten.</p>

<p>I produced a lot of exploratory art for the project but the comic was never completed.</p>

<p>I began writing a story with those same characters while in Tahihi, french polynesia in 2017. Because of laptop problems, drawing using heavy software like Photoshop was near impossible, and so we were forced to consider other hobbies. The story is inspired from our own travels and discoveries.</p>

<p>I decided to make the book gender neutral, namely because I am "gender agnostic", but also because I thrive with constraints. It's not something I've seen done often, and it happens to work well with the Wiktopher universe(which is quite alien).</p>

<p>The writing of the book was completed on October 2nd 2021, but we finished <a href="../media/content/projects/wiktopher_05.jpg">corrections</a> on November 15th 2023. Devine did a lot of editing for this project. The book was published digitally on November 25th 2023.</p>

<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html" target="_blank">Pandoc</a> and <a href="https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/index.html" target="_blank">Tectonic</a> were used to convert <a href="https://garrettgman.github.io/rmarkdown/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html" target="_blank">Markdown</a>(main text is written in Markdown) and TeX files into PDF files, and to generate an EPUB. A mobi file was generated from the EPUB file using <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" target="_blank">Calibre</a>. Disclaimer: Rek doesn't master the use of TeX(but their skills get better with every published book, this is Rek's second book produced with TeX and Pandoc), there are probably better ways to produce a book, reference the project's source files at your own risk.</p>
