<p>Because I don't always have a lot of power available on the boat I have a two workstations, one for regular usage named {Vincent}, and the other for low-power situations named {Obi}.</p>

<p>I draw by hand a lot, and digitize the drawings by either photographing them, or scanning them. In 2022 I bought a used CanoScanLIde20(see {using a scanner under linux}) to scan comic pages for {Hakum}.</p>

<p>I clean all my art in Gimp. Most of my art nowadays are line drawings, which take up less space, and are easier to process with simple tools. I like to dither (using <a href='https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/didder' target='_blank'>didder</a>, and a local copy of <a href='https://ditherit.com' target='_blank'>dither-it</a>) my art to save space, but also because I like the look.</p>

<p>I mainly draw on paper, but I also sometimes use an old <b>Ipad 2</b> to draw using Autodesk Sketchbook (no stylus). It isn't the best software ever, not sure I'd recommend it, but I use it since I have it. The Ipad 2's battery lasts a long, long time, and it charges quickly.</p>

<p>When producing creative work, I like to make sure that my skills aren't dependent on any particular software(see {software nomad}), and prioritize open-source tools.</p>
