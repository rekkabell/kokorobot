<p>I am an adult, and I learned very late that I've been brushing my teeth wrong. As a kid, I had access to yearly dentist services, courtesy of my parent's dental insurance, but as soon as I was on my own I stopped going because I couldn't afford to go. My teeth were problem-free for most of my adult life, but I started having problems in my 30's.</p>

<p>I would brush my teeth once a day before bed, rinse the toothpaste away with water afterwards, and would only floss when I had something stuck in my teeth. I was taught that this was enough. Evidently, it wasn't, but I was also not brushing or flossing correctly...</p>

<P>I went for a dentist visit last year(2023), the dentist asked me when was the last time I had come in for an appointment... it had been over 10 years. I did say but I didn't want to, it was embarassing, it didn't matter if I hadn't said it though because they could see it when looking at my teeth. The reason I visited was because I had a tooth ache, due to a cavity on a tooth at the back of my mouth. I had 4 cavities filled on that visit.</p>

<p>That same day, the dentist told me that my gums bled easily and that this a tell-tale sign of gingivitis. I am glad that I caught this early, because gingivitis can evolve into periodontitis, a more serious disorder that causes gum recession, damage to soft and hard tissues, and eventually tooth loss.</p>

I have since read up a lot on oral health. I feel bad that I didn't learn about this earlier. I try and visit the dentist once a year now, even if it's not cheap(although they'd prefer I visit every 6 months).</p>

<p>Here is what my oral care routine looks like now:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I <b>floss</b> my teeth right after my last meal of the day.</li>
	<li>After flossing my teeth I rinse my mouth with <b>mouthwash</b></li>
	<li>I <b>brush</b> my teeth <b>twice a day</b>, when I wake up, and before I go to bed. I don't rinse with water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flossing</h2>

<p>Because my teeth are tight flossing is essential, brushing isn't enough to dislodge food bits between my teeth. When flossing ...</p>

<ul>
	<li>I take a long length(25-50 cm | 10-20 inches) of floss and wrap each end around my two middle fingers until I have close to 5 cm (2 inches) of floss left in-between.</li>
	<li>I curve the floss so that it wraps against the side of the tooth I am cleaning, in a sort of exagerated C-shape. I move the floss up and down gently, then invert the C-shape and clean the other tooth neighboring the one I just finished(in the same tooth gap).</li>
	<li>Everytime I move to clean a new tooth, I use a clean section of floss.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mouthwash</h2>

<p>Because my gums are currently showing signs of gingivitis, I am for the moment(maybe not forever) using mouthwash to make sure that my mouth is germ-free after flossing my teeth (mouthwash isn't essential to oral health).</p>

<p>I don't use mouthwash after brushing my teeth because it washes all of the fluoride. Antiseptic mouthwash is the most common type of mouthwash, other types include varieties with fluoride and with alcohol-free options(I use alcohol-free)</p>

<p>When using mouthwash, I use the amount recommended on the bottle(about 4 tsps), and swish the liquid around in my mouth for 30 seconds. I spit the liquid, but I don't rinse my mouth. I wait at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything(even water). I repeat, I <b>do not</b> rinse the mouthwash away with water because mouthwash uses ingredients — like fluoride or antiseptics — that continue to act even after I spit it out, rinsing washes these beneficial compounds away.</p>

<q>More brushing doesn’t automatically equate to better oral health, the quality of the brushing matters a lot.</q>

<h2>Brushings</h2>

<p>I takes me a long time to brush my teeth, I go slow and try not to brush too hard(I've been guilty of that in the past, injuring my gums). This is how I now brush my teeth:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Outside of the teeth</b>. I start with the outside surfaces of my teeth. I go slow, tooth by tooth. I tilt the brush at a 45° angle, then move it in short strokes against the gumline.</li>
	<li><b>Inside of the teeth</b>. I use the same technique as with the outside of my teeth, but I go slower, trying to pay attention to each tooth. Because I can't see what tooth I am brushing it is easy to skip one..</li>
	<li><b>Top of the teeth</b>. I run the brush back and forth along the topsides of my teeth.</li>
	<li><b>Front teeth inside</b>. In the end, I like to brush the inside of my front top and lower teeth, brushing against the gumline.</li>
	<li><b>Tongue</b>. I brush my tongue.</li>
	<li><b>Rinsing</b>. I spit out the toothpaste(the one I use has fluoride), but I do not rinse it away with water. The left-over toothpaste acts as a chemical to break down germs over time. There's not enough leftover in your mouth to cause problems, but enough to protect your teeth. Wait at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few additional tips:</p>

<p><b>Don't brush your teeth right after eating</b>. Rinsing with water is fine. Brushing your teeth after a meal, especially if it's acidic, is not great because the enamel is a bit softer and it can damage your teeth. It is best to wait 30-60 minutes after brushing to avoid damaging the enamel.</p>

<p><b>In the morning, brush before breakfast, not after.</b>. During sleep, plaque-causing bacteria can proliferate. Brushing just after waking up can help remove these potentially harmful oral bacteria, increase saliva production and provide a protective barrier over the tooth enamel. Those who prefer to brush after eating breakfast ought to wait 30 minutes and avoid consuming acidic foods. (Note that this advice is primarily for those who are cavity-prone, you can brush right after breakfast, but if you use toothpaste with fluoride you'll wash away all of the benefits of using it).</p>
