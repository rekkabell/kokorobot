<p>Rabbit Waves serves as a vessel to expand in a playful way using hand drawn illustrations, on some of our favourite subjects, like communication, hand tools, food preservation, and seafaring. It began in November 2024, and is ongoing.</p>

<p>The idea came after discussing the disappearance of certain traditional seasteading skills and maritime communication knowledge that we believe are valuable when electronics misbehave, but that are also just generally fun to learn and use.</p>

<p>All of the Rabbit Waves are is done by hand, with ink and coloring pencils. The art is scanned and processed digitally.</p>
