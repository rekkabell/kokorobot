<p>A guide I illustrated to accompany the release of <a href='https://100r.co/site/donsol.html' target="_blank">Donsol NES</a>, a game written entirely in 6502 assembly (published in 2020). The booklet is available with the purchase of the game. The game was ported to {Uxn} in <b>October 2021</b>.</p>

<p>You are free to print the booklet for your personal use, the box art and <a href='../media/content/donsol_cartridge.jpg'/>cartridge cover</a> are also included in the download. The logo of the cartridge cover was made using <a href='https://100r.co/site/dotgrid' target='_blank'>Dotgrid</a>.</p>
