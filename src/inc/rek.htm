<p>I am a cartoonist and sailor, currently based in the Salish Sea, where the weather is mild and kinder to sailboats. I enjoy drawing with pencils and ballpoint pens, and am fond of lacto-fermentation, bikes, and seabirds.</p>

<p><img src="../media/interface/ikaruga.gif" style="float: left"><img src="../media/interface/esserawks_mew.gif" style="float: left">With the project {HundredRabbits}, I write about practical knowledge, while producing fun-weird art projects with my best friend and most treasured human <a href="https://xxiivv.com" target="_blank">Devine</a>.</p>

<p>Living on a boat with the goal of conserving energy use has shaped how I work in a very big way. My workshop is powered by 200W of solar. I prioritize art done on paper. Digital works are done with the tools of my <a href='https://100r.co' target='_blank'>studio</a> and/or with open-source software(Gimp). For more details on how I work, read this article I wrote named <a href='https://100r.co/site/working_offgrid_efficiently.html' target='_blank'>Working Offgrid Efficiently</a></p>

<p>I occasionally make art for magazines, children's books, as well as visuals for software and game. My first self-published game {Oquonie} was nominated for a visual arts award at the <a href='https://igf.com/2015' target="_blank">2015 Independent Games Festival</a> in San Francisco. In 2020 Devine & I self-published {Busy Doing Nothing}, a book documenting my 50-day sail from Shimoda to Victoria. As of December 10th 2024, we have sold 1535 copies, all outside of toxic distribution platforms like Amazon.</p>

<p>I spend my days documenting repairs on the boat, making recipes for {GrimGrains}, making <a href="../site/hakum.html">comics</a>, and documenting worthwhile seafaring, safety, and communication skills through {Rabbit Waves} and {Hundredrabbits}.</p>

<p>Devine & I lived in Japan for two years, and after returning to Canada we decided to try and return there by sailboat. And so, we circumnavigated the Pacific Ocean by sail, passing through Mexico, French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga, New Zealand, Fiji, The Marshall Islands and Japan.</p>

<p><img src="../media/interface/melon.gif" alt='a gif of a happy melon bouncing in a loop' style="float: left">I've been making websites since I was a teenager, I would farm free geocities space by hot-linking between mutiple accounts—I've since abandoned that practice. These days, I enjoy making and maintaining simple websites. I manage <a href='https://grimgrains.com' target="_blank">Grimgrains</a>, <a href="https://100r.co" target="_blank">100r.co</a> and <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca" target="_blank">Rabbit Waves</a>.</p>
