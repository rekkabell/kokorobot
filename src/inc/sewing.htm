<p>This page documents small sewing projects that were done by hand, sometimes using a speedy stitcher(sewing awl). I have a sewing machine, but I also enjoy the quiet and slow process of sewing by hand.</p>

<p>Hand-stitched a case for my evergrowing collection of coloring pencils :>!</p>

<p>I used cotton canvas leftover from a previous project and harvested a zipper from a <a href="../media/content/basmati.jpg">basmati rice bag</a>[124 KiB](the kind Dev & I like to buy comes in a burlap bag with a zipper).</p>

<h3>Sleeping mask</h3>
<p><b>January 15th 2025</b></p>

<img src="../media/content/sewing_sleepingmask.jpg" alt="rek wearing a diy sleeping mask" loading="lazy"></a> 

<p>My eyes are very dry. I use eye ointment at night to keep my eyes hydrated, but I was told that using a sleeping mask on top of that will help trap moisture (i may sleep with my eyes partially open at night...). The mask is very crude, but I've spent a night with it already and it is very comfortable.</p>

<p>I used an elastic band I had lying around, I think it was once used to keep a yoga mat rolled up (my friend forgot hers here many years ago, the yoga mat is long gone but I still had the elastics).</p>

<h3>Arm warmers</h3>

<p>Because it's getting cold aboard, I got a used fleece airplane blanket from a thrift store and used it to make 4 pairs of arm warmers for myself and for Devine. I stitched these up by hand. I drew the template on the fabric, planning the design so that I would only have to sew one side. I hemmed the edges(by folding the edges) for the forearm and finger exits, but haven't bothered to do it for the thumb because fleece doesn't unravel and wont fray.<br>When hemming the edges by folding, I was careful to keep the stitching loose(zigzag stitch would also help but I was too lazy to do it) to allow for some stretch.</p>

<h3>Winter Jacket</h3>
<p><b>November 2nd 2023</b></p>

<p>Replacing a jacket zipper for the first time. The teeth of the zipper were so worn at one end they couldn't bite, and the coat zipper would keep opening from the bottom.</p>

<p>Did one side, now doing the other. The other side is a bit tougher cause there's more layers. The stitching it strong but isn't super clean cause I have to do it by hand(too many layers for the sewing machine).</p>

<p>I learned a few things while trying to do this fix. For instance, there are many ways that zippers fail. It's not always necessary to replace the whole thing. Sometimes a new zipper slider or bottom stop is enough to fix a coat opening from the bottom.</p>

<img src="../media/content/sewing_zip_02.jpg" loading="lazy"></a> 

<p>It's possible to buy parts separately or to get a kit. I had to replace the whole thing because the teeth were too badly worn.</p>

<p>The hardest bit was getting the old stitches out to get the zipper off (was very well put together).</p>

<h3>Tea Cosy</h3>
<p><b>April 23rd 2023</b></p>

<p>A friend gave us his old oven mitts when he moved out of his boat last year(spring 2022). I cut them up, combined, and re-stitched them into a sort of tea cosy for my percolator(which I use as a kettle).</p>

<p>When I need hot water refills for tea I can keep water warm for a while this way.</p>

<img src="../media/content/sewing_teacosy_01.jpg" loading="lazy"></a> 

<p>The two mitts became one. I stitched on an old elastic band I had around the thumb/spout opening and the bottom of the tea cosy to hide the seams.</p>

<h3>Curtain</h3>

<p><b>March 21st 2021</b></p>

<p>Made a little curtain for an area where we keep spices and drinks. Shields them from light, and will keep them from falling out of that space.</p>

<p>The curtain has two pockets sown in, with a wooden dowel on each end.</p>

<p>The rabbit fabric was a gift from a friend in Japan. Been carrying it around a while, but only just found a use for it!</p>

<h3>Cushions</h3>
<p><b>March 14th 2021</b></p>

<img src="../media/content/sewing_cushion_01.jpg" loading="lazy"></a> 

<p>The cushions we had aboard Pino were old, and flat. I cut them open today, and removed the inside and instead stuffed them with some extra clean towels, rags and winter socks. We don't have a ton of storage space, so this helps :D. Now the cushions are nice and plump.</p>

<img src="../media/content/sewing_cushion_02.jpg" loading="lazy"></a> 

<p>Did not have extra zippers or buttons on hand to close the cushions up again, so I used some Japanese coins from our last trip (the 5 yen with the hole in the middle) as buttons with some bits of old paracord.</p>
