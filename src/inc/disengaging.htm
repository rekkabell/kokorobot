<p><b>Context</b>. This is during a time before the {Solomons devils} existed, not too long after Kaddali and Hazaki met at a protest against a development project in the Taiga.

<p>I will add sequences that precede and follow this one soon.</p>

<p><b>Content Warning</b>. <i>Some swearing.</i></p>
