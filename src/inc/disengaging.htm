<h3>Disengaging</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. This is during a time before the Solomon's Devils existed, not too long after Kaddali and Hazaki met at a protest against a development project in the Taiga. "Half-lifers", or "Near-deads", are common insults used by katkum, used towards humans to refer to the fact that they live very short lives.</p>

<p>In the below comic, the front of Hakazi's shirt reads, "Stay out of the Taiga half-lifers", and the back reads, "Save a tree, bury a near dead."</p>

<p><b>Content Warning</b>. <i>Some swearing.</i></p>
