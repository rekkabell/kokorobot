<p><b>Note</b>. Some parts of the comic will appear a bit different than the rest, and that is because most of it was done in the summer of 2022, but some panels and pages were added in april 2023 (for some smoothing between moments), and it seems like I am better at drawing them now :>. I am glad of it, but it also means there are some clear differences. Oh weeeelll~!</p>
