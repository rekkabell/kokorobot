<hr>
<p>Shiba Killy is a genial hound, a stoic, and the cure to {Cee}'s anxieties. Killy is outgoing, and never fails to bring Cee along, and to protect her. He often puts her into situations that are difficult, he is her link to society, her bridge to the world.</p>
<p>Killy likes pickled foods and to wear ridiculously long scarves.</p>
