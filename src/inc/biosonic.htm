 <p>Biosonic was an event series organized by <a href='https://activepassive.ca/index.html' target='_blank'>ActivePassive</a> exploring the intersections of music, art and biodiversity. On March 5-12th 2023 {Devine} & I traveled to Galiano Island for the event.</p>
 
 <p>The drawings for the slideshow were drawn by hand, inked, scanned, lightly processed in GIMP and included in <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/adelie.html' target='_blank'>Adelie</a>, our slideshow program.</p>

<p>During our week-long stay, we were kindly hosted at the <a href='https://lenaresidency.com/' target='_blank'>LEÑA artist residency</a>.</p>

<h3>Talk<br>23.03.10. Galiano South Hall</h3>

<p>Living on a sailboat with the aim to use less energy means that nature decides what you can do, and when. In this talk we explain how this way of doing things has affected how we live, how we make art, and how we view and use technology.</p>

<p>All of the photos featured below were taken by photographer <a href='https://www.daynaszyndrowski.com/' target='_blank'>Dayna Szyndrowski</a>.</p>

<h3>E*Collage*Y<br>23.03.10. Galiano South Hall</h3>

<p>Earlier that same day, I attended and helped facilitate a collage workshop organized by <a href='https://www.anjusingh.com/about/' target='_blank'>Anju Singh</a>. The aim of the workshop was to use collage as a storytelling vehicle to share our stories, experiences, and relationships with the ecology and biodiversity of the island and the space around us. I did a simple little collage of <a href="../media/content/talks/biosonic/collage3.jpg" target="_blank">my own</a>, using plants found on the islands.</p>
