<h2>2025-09-01 What's Broken...</h2>

<p>I have really enjoyed the past few weeks, which have been less travel-focused, and more centered around seeing friends, foraging for fruit(blackberries, plums and apples), and getting projects done. I have been making illustrations for the Victoria to Sitka Logbook project, which I hope to publish early next year. Putting books together is a fun, but very slow process. For the last few weeks we have been at a dock(for free, yay!) to watch over a friend's house while they are away, and so used this time to make repairs to our beloved vessel. The bilge pump, alternator, and anchor light all failed and needed replacing. When things on boats break, it is always in groups of 3 for some obscure reason.<br>Replacing these items is expensive. Repairing both the bilge pump and the alternator is not an option, both have broken in irreparable ways. One of the metal brackets used to secure the alternator to the engine is damaged, and for the bilge pump, the water sensor is completely sealed and can't be replaced. We would prefer to have a design that isn't sealed, but our options are limited at the moment. We just need something that works.<br>I am sad to say that while purchasing one particular item I was targeted by a malicious individual. All is ok now, but untangling it all was not fun. The timing was not ideal(to be fair, it never is). Devine & I make under 29,000$CAD(not individually, as a combined salary) every year on game sales from Itch.io, Bandcamp sales, book sales from lulu.com and monthly donations on Patreon. We are able to survive on this because we are thrifty, but keeping up with the rising costs of things, as well as the rapid devaluing of the kind of creative work that we do(hello, AI), is a challenge. We are not sure we can keep wintering in Victoria next year for this reason. We'll see how it goes, both of us are considering finding extra work.</p>

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. Since I my last update, I can do 1 full pull-up from a fully extended position, and can continue on to do about 3 more. Progress is slow, but good. I haven't been as diligent with my resistance band training these last few weeks, mostly because being near land has allowed for daily bike rides.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I drew some <a href="../media/content/sunflower_group.jpg" target="_blank">sunflowers</a> for <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/sunflower-basic" target="_blank">Sunflower BASIC</a>. In this same line of thinking, I illustrated a tribute to an artwork by Moebius(a cover for Alice BASIC) for the Hundred Rabbits August newsletter, see it <a href="../media/content/sunflower_basic.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>I continue to draw entries for <a href='punk_rabbits.html' class='local'>punk rabbits</a>, I now have a collection of 34 rabbits! I try and draw one every 2-3 days, slowly working my way up to one hundred. Speaking of which, this coming November will be the 10th year anniversary of <a href='hundredrabbits.html' class='local'>hundredrabbits</a>!</p>

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I finished reading Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie, a book several people had mentioned to me after I told them about <a href='wiktopher.html' class='local'>wiktopher</a> because the author uses she/her pronouns for every character. I enjoyed the world that Leckie built, she did a good job of characterizing the different cultures, by the way they speak, gesture, dress, etc. I had a hard time keeping up with the many political intrigues of the book, I think I will have to re-read it again.</p>

<p><b>MOVIE</b>. Scavengers Reign is an incredible series about the survivors of the interstellar cargo vessel Demeter, stranded on an alien planet. The planet is a very beautiful but also very hostile place, with some local fauna and flora able to interact and integrate with machinery. The animation, background art, the characters, the dialogues, the story, all of it is absolutely phenomenal. It is so rare to come upon western adult animation of this quality nowadays, finding this was incredibly comforting, especially in this age of incessant generated soulless garbage. I think that it is the best thing I have watched this year, so far(with Sinners at its heels). Next on my list is Common Side Effects, another series produced by the same studio(Green Street Pictures).</p>

<q>The makers of AI aren’t damned by their failures, they’re damned by their goals. They want to build a genie to grant them wishes, and their wish is that nobody ever has to make art again. They want to create a new kind of mind, so they can force it into mindless servitude. Their dream is to invent new forms of life to enslave. And to what end? In a kind of nihilistic symmetry, their dream of the perfect slave machine drains the life of those who use it as well as those who turn the gears. What is life but what we choose, who we know, what we experience? </q>
