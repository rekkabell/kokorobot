<p><b>2025.01.10</b>. On January 1st 2024, I stopped drinking alcohol. I've been meaning to stop for a long time, namely because I knew it was a health risk, and because it was, for me, a social crutch. Even if I was aware of the risks, I found it difficult to stop, so how did I manage this?</p>

<p>I wish I had a personal recipe for success that others could replicate, but I don't, I was able to stop drinking because my hereditary rosacea finally kicked in. When drinking any amount of alcohol, rosacea caused my face to flush, and for my cheeks to tingle and burn. I would feel tired, and generally unwell. The reddening was also a source of embarrassment for me, because it appeared as though I had been drinking a lot(I'd get that way after consuming just one 4% beer).</p>

<p>As I've already mentioned, I was looking to stop because I relied on it too much to relax in social situations, and because I knew it was a health risk. My rosacea forced my hand, it was the excuse I needed.</p>

<p>If you're looking to limit how much you drink, read about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drink-less-be-your-best/getting-started-with-drinking-less/index.html" target="_blank">strategies to start drinking less</a>(CDC recommendations).</p>

<h3>What does drinking alcohol do to the body?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>It <b>damages DNA</b><br><i>Alcohol creates unstable molecules called free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, and cells. Ethanol breaks down into acetaldehyde, and it also induces oxidative stress, two things that can cause an increased risk of cancer.</i></li>
	<li>It <b>alters levels of multiple hormones</b></b><br><i>It alters levels of estrogen and testosterone which increases cancers at hormone-sensitive sites like breasts and prostate.</i></li>
	<li>It <b>depletes levels of essential nutrients</b><br><i>It depletes B vitamins and folate that help protect the body against cancer.</i></li>
	<li>It leads to <b>greater absorption of carcinogens.</b><br><i>Carcinogens dissolve in alcohol. The alcohol alters the cells in the mouth and throat which causes carcinogens to be more readily absorbed.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>The link between alcohol consumption and cancer risk are well established for at least <b>seven types of cancer</b>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>breast</li>
	<li>colorectal</li>
	<li>esophagus</li>
	<li>liver</li>
	<li>mouth</li>
	<li>throat</li>
	<li>voice box</li>
</ul>

<p>The risk remains regardless of what type of alcohol is consumed, and it increases with greater consumption.</p>

<p>It affects <b>women</b> disproportionately, because women are generally smaller and have more body fat than men. If a man and a woman drink the same amount, a woman will have higher blood levels of alcohol. Drinking while having higher body fat disrupts hormonal balance, which can spur the development of cancers of the breast and prostate.</p>

<p>Just like taking cocaine was a "hip" and harmless thing to do in 19th century England, or that prior to 1964 cigarettes weren't considered harmful, the touted health benefits of drinking alcohol are now being challenged. Over the past three years, a steady stream of scientific evidence and comprehensive research reviews have largely disproved it.</p>

<p>As we learn, we must adapt.</p>

<h3>NA drinks</h3>

<p>So far, I have been content drinking NA craft beers and mocktails, there is a lot more variety available in grocery stores than there used to be(at least, this is true in Canada). Although, when going out, not all bars offer fun options for non-drinkers, I often have to drink carbonated water/club soda/seltzer with lemon(not super fun), and I am unfortunately not a fan of soft drinks or of kombucha.</p>

<p>In all though, I want to severely cut back on drinking/eating out because it costs too much these days, and I don't tolerate noisy environments as well as I used to.</p>

<h3>And now, a poem</h3>

<p>Here is the full length poem by Emily Dickinson, intoxicated by nature and fresh summer air, quoted in the ASCII art in the header of this short article:</p>

<p><i>I taste a liquor never brewed –<br>
From Tankards scooped in Pearl –<br>
Not all the Frankfort Berries<br>
Yield such an Alcohol!</i></p>

<p><i>Inebriate of air – am I –<br>
And Debauchee of Dew –<br>
Reeling – thro’ endless summer days –<br>
From inns of molten Blue …</i></p>
