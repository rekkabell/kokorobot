<p>In the words of its <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/goblinweek" target="_blank">creator</a>, <i>Goblin Week is an event in which you make goblins every day for a week, whatever that means to you.</i>. It's a low-pressure community art project, meant to spread joy and creativity, participants are encouraged to "follow their heart." There are no strict rules.</p>

<p>Entries are usually tagged under <b>#goblinweek</b>.</p>

<p>I participated for the first time in January 2025(Jan 19-25th), here are my entries:</p>
