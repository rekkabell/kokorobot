<!-- Generated file, do not edit -->

<p>This is a list of notes I've compiled when came time to learn how to generate PDFs, and e-books with free, open-source software.</p>

<p>I have built books on Elementary OS and Manjaro with much success. I've tried to describe how to install everything in detail. If you don't have command-line experience, don't get discouraged! It is very tricky (it gets easier, with time). Seek the help of someone you know who can sit with you to help you install these, I find it easier to learn with someone in person, especially someone who knows you well (knows your level, how you learn best etc). Otherwise, ask me and I will try my best to assist you (rek at kokorobot dot ca). If I don't answer right away, it may be because I am sailing and away from a cell tower. I will return your email as soon as I can!</p>

<p>Some of these are tricky to install, please refer to my <a href='pandoc_install.html' class='local'>pandoc install</a> tutorial if you have problems. If you only have plans to export a PDF, only install Pandoc, Pdfunite and LateX. To generate MOBIs and EPUBs with Pandoc, install Pandoc, ImageMagick and Calibre.</p>

<p>Now that you've installed all necessary tools, let's begin:</p>

<h3><a id='whatispandoc'>What is Pandoc?</a></h3>

<p><a href='https://pandoc.org/index.html' target="_blank">Pandoc</a> is a terminal utility that converts files from one markup format into another. You can convert an HTML page to Markdown, Markdown to PDF, Markdown to EPUB etc. It's a useful tool to create articles, scientific papers, and books.</p>

<p>When generating PDFs, Pandoc's use of <a href='https://www.latex-project.org/' target="_blank">LaTeX</a> (a document preparation system) encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content. To find out how to install LaTeX, read <a href='pandocinstall.html#latex'>my tutorial</a>.</p> 

<h3><a id='markdown'>Pandoc Markdown</a></h3>

<p>Make sure that the file you want turned into a PDF has an <b>.md</b> extension, and take note of the path to your project file, as you'll need that to generate your PDF later. The next step is to add Pandoc Markdown syntax to the text.</p>

<p><a href='https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html%23raw-tex' target="_blank">Pandoc Markdown</a> is an extended and slightly revised version of John Gruber’s <a href='https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/' target="_blank">Markdown syntax</a>. Markdown is a simple, and easy-to-use markup language to format plain-text content. This language is used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.</p>

<p>For example, to make text <b>bold</b>, add two asterisks on each side of the word:</p>

<pre>In January 2016, we bought our first sailboat, a **Yamaha 33**.</pre>

<p>Hash symbols preceding a word or phrase make a heading. Be sure to add a space between the hash and the first word:</p>

<pre>## Introduction</pre>

<img src="../media/interface/markdown.jpg" loading='lazy' class='tools'>

<p>One hash would make the title bigger, three would make the heading smaller, four even smaller, five even smaller etc. Headings are important too for creating epubs, as Pandoc will use the headers to generate the table of contents of your e-book.</p>

<p>There is no easy equivalent to adding indents in the text, but it is possible by adding a bunch of spaces using:</p>

<pre>
&amp;nbsp;
</pre>

<p>It is <b>very</b> hacky though. I've not yet found a solution for this, not a simple one anyway. When writing paragraphs, <b>always add two spaces after each one</b> if you want spacing between them.</p>

<p><b>Footnotes.</b> To add footnotes to the text, add a number between square brackets after a specific word, like so: <b>[^1]</b>. An example text:</p>

<pre>Licky root[^1] is a popular herb because...</pre>

<p>The <b>[^1]</b> will render as a small '1' in the exported version of the text. Then in the document (end, beginning, doesn't matter), add the same number between square brackets again, followed with the footnotes you wish to have (directly following the number). For example:</p>

<pre>[^1]: Licky root is a plant that is often brewed as tea.</pre>

<p>That text won't appear in the document end, it'll appear on the same page where with the marker. This is what it will look like in the text:</p>

<img src="../media/interface/footnotes.jpg" loading='lazy' class='tools'>

<h3><a id='txtpdf'>From Markdown to PDF</a></h3>

<p>To generate a PDF from your <b>.md</b> or <b>.txt</b> file, locate your project file using the terminal. Navigate to your project folder. The example below is if you'd saved your project file to Documents, under a folder named <b>myproject</b>.:</p>

<pre>cd Documents/myproject/</pre>

<p>Enter the following command, replacing <b>filename</b> with the name of your project file, and <b>filename_export</b> with for the final exported PDF file:</p>

<pre>pandoc filename.txt --pdf-engine=xelatex -o filename_export.pdf</pre>

<p>In that same folder where you had your .txt file saved, you'll find your Pandoc-generated PDF.</p>

<h3><a id='extensions'>Using Pandoc Markdown Extensions</a></h3>

<p>In Pandoc, you can use extensions (see below) to specify the output of your PDF more granularly, say, if you want to change the paper size, add tables or footnotes etc.</p>

<h3><a id='papersize'>Changing papersize</a></h3>

<p>By default, the Pandoc PDF format is a4. If you want to change it, you'll have to add the following when generating the PDF in the command line:</p>

<pre>--variable=geometry:a5paper</pre>

<p>Appended with the rest, to generate the PDF from a Markdown file, it'll look like this:</p>

<pre>pandoc --variable=geometry:a5paper filename.txt --pdf-engine=xelatex -o filename_export.pdf</pre>

<p>If you're file is a <b>.md</b>, change the extension of your project file.</p>

<h3><a id='addext'>Adding extensions</a></h3>

<p>If you want add tables, you'll have to add an extension. Extensions are specified in the command line when generating a pdf. In the example below, after <b>-- from markdown</b>, I've added a <b>+</b> followed by the extension <b>simple tables</b>. If the extension name has two words, adding an underscore between them is necessary.</p>

<pre>--from markdown+simple_tables</pre>

<p>You can add more extensions, adding a <b>+</b> inbetween each one. In the example below, I've added both <b>simple tables</b> and <b>citations</b>.</p>

<pre>--from markdown+simple_tables+citations</pre>

<p>Below is an example of a terminal command for a PDF generated from a .txt file, in a5 format, with the simple tables extension.</p>

<pre>pandoc --variable=geometry:a5paper filename.txt --pdf-engine=xelatex --from markdown+simple_tables -o filename_export.pdf</pre>

<h3><a id='bookcover'>Book cover PDF</a></h3>

<p>Adding a book cover for a PDF with Pandoc is not straightforward, or maybe there is something I am missing? I could not figure out how to add images as full-page covers, BUT—I found a workaround to do it...and again (another big BUT), it requires <a href='https://imagemagick.org/index.php' target="_blank">ImageMagick</a>.</p>

<p>We will use ImageMagick to convert the cover image into a PDF, which in turn, we will combine together into yet another PDF.</p>

<p>Once you've installed ImageMagick (see <a href='pandoc_install.html'>tutorial</a> for install), save your cover image in your project folder. If you put it in a separate folder, be sure to specify it. Now, use this ImageMagick command to convert the image to a PDF:</p>

<pre>convert cover.jpg cover.pdf</pre>

<p>To combine the cover PDF with the main text PDF use pdfunite. *Note that the combined.pdf is the name of your final, merged pdf:</p>

<pre>pdfunite cover.pdf filename.pdf combined.pdf</pre>

<p>I am sure that this isn't the best way to do this, but it works! Sometimes hacky hacks are fine, but by all means, if you have a better solution, do say!</p>

<h3><a id='epub'>Making epubs</a></h3>

<p>EPUB is a popular ebook format, but if you convert a Markdown file to an epub it may break some of your formatting. For example, EPUBs ignore the <b>\newpage</b> Markdown tag, but assigning a <b>page break</b> to a specific level of header with css fixes that problem. For EPUBs it is a good idea to use css to control the final look of the document.</p>

<p>First step is to create a blank text file, and to save it as <b>epub.css</b>.</p>

<p>I prefer not to modify the look too much, so I keep my css to minimum. For example:</p>

<pre>
body &lbrace;font-size: 14px&rbrace;
table &lbrace;font-size: 14px&rbrace;
h4 &lbrace;page-break-before: always;&rbrace;
h2 &lbrace;page-break-before: always;&rbrace;
blockquote &lbrace;font-style: italic;&rbrace;
img &lbrace;max-width: 100%&rbrace;
</pre>

<p>I don't recommend setting a fixed font size like in the example above, as the font may be too small to read on a phone. I specified a <b>max-width</b> for images otherwise they have a tendency to spill out of the page. Of course, these are only a few of the many things one can do to improve the look of documents with css.</p>

<p>When exporting the file as an EPUB with Pandoc, add the extension like the above example, along with arguments to generate a table of contents from your list of headers, the book's metadata, a book cover and your css file.</p> 

<p><b>Table of Contents:</b> To change the name of the table of the contents generated by Pandoc, add the following command, changing 'custom text' for the desired name of your table of contents:</p>

<pre>-V toc-title:"Custom text"</pre>

<p>If the table of contents depth is not specified, it defaults to 3 (level 1, 2 and 3 headers will be included in the generated table of contents). To keep the table to a depth of level 2, add:</p>

<pre>--toc-depth=2</pre>

<p><b>Metadata file:</b> A metadata file includes all the author, rights and publishing information. Create a new file and save it as <b>metadata.yaml</b>. Then, add the following:</p>

<pre>
---
title: Busy Doing Nothing
subtitle: 51 days from Canada to Japan
author: Rek Bell
publisher: Hundredrabbits
table-of-contents: true
lang: en-CA
rights: © 2021 MyCompany, *your chosen license*
documentclass: book
...
</pre>

<p><b>**NOTE</b>: The three most commonly used standard document-classes in LaTeX include: article, report and book. Different document-classes have different default settings. The first time I published a book I omitted adding a document class entirely, and the text renders fine. Adding a "book" class will add settings that make the text more pleasant to read, like it'll align text on either the left, or right, to account for the book binding, it'll also add the chapter name at the top of the page.</p>

<p>The text in the .yaml file need to be delimited by a line of three hyphens (---) at the top and a line of three hyphens (---) or three dots (...) at the bottom. Metadata will be taken from the fields of the YAML object and added to any existing document metadata. See more about <a href='https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-blocks' target="_blank">metadata files</a>. Next, pass it to Pandoc as an argument:</p>

<pre>--epub-metadata=metadata.yaml</pre>

<p><b>Book cover</b>: To add a cover, save the file to the folder with the rest of your text, and pass it to Pandoc as an argument:</p>

<pre>--epub-cover-image=cover.jpg</pre>

<p>The final Pandoc command to convert a file from Markdown to EPUB would look like this (with variations, depending on the extensions you choose):</p>

<pre>~pandoc filename.md --from markdown+simple_tables+line_blocks --toc -V toc-title:"Table of Contents" --toc-depth=2 --epub-metadata=metadata.yaml --epub-cover-image=cover.jpg --css epub.css -w epub -o filename.epub</pre>

<p>Test your book on a variety of devices before publishing it.</p>

<h3><a id='mobi'>MOBI</a></h3>

<p>Pandoc cannot convert files to MOBI, but it's possible to convert it using <b>Calibre</b>. To start, make an EPUB (steps above). To find out how to install Calibre, read <a href='pandoc_install.html#calibre'>my tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Run the following command in the terminal:</p>

<pre>ebook-convert "input_file.epub" "output_file.mobi"</pre>

<p>input_file is the input and output_file is the output. Both must be specified as the first two arguments to the command. It's possible to add more options to further change the look of the output file. There are too many options to name here, but all are listed <a href='https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Calibre doubles as a book viewer, so you can test your book on that. Note that like with an EPUB, test the file on as many devices as you can.</p>

<p>Now, all that's left is to publish your e-book! I personally choose not to use Amazon, and publish on <a href='https://itch.io/' target="_blank">itch.io</a>. There are no publishing fees, and with it, it's possible to automate uploads using <a href='https://itch.io/docs/butler/' target="_blank">Butler</a> (itch.io's command line tools) if say, you want to publish changes to your book fast.</p>
