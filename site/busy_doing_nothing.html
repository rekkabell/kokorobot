<p>Busy Doing Nothing is a 218-page book, chronicling daily happenings on the 51-day passage of <a href='https://100r.co/'>HundredRabbits</a> from Japan to Canada.</p>

<p>The <a href='https://100r.co/site/north_pacific_logbook.html' target="_blank">original logbook</a> was transcribed, and released online in August 2020. On February 17th 2021, Hundredrabbits released a formatted revised edition for e-readers with extra content. On December 3rd 2021, we released a <a href='https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/rekka-bellum-and-devine-lu-linvega/busy-doing-nothing/paperback/product-rqgmdj.html?page=1&pageSize=4' target='_blank'>paperback version</a>.</p>

<p>It was my dream to make this long, non-stop sail, following in the footsteps of my heroine Lin Pardey. She wrote a book chronicling their trip from Japan to Victoria, mixed with stories of past learnings from her many years of experience as a cook on sailboats.</p>

<p>I do not have Lin's experience, but I liked the idea of journaling every day. I thought a trip that long was worth documenting. Sailing isn't just about pleasure, it's also about boredom, very high highs, very low lows, and on finding ways to keep sane while in a small, small space surrounded by a wild, wild, and wet universe.</p>

<p>I kept a handwritten log, and drew little cartoons in the margins when I felt down, or scared. Many drawings are from the original log, but I drew many new ones to decorate the pages (I didn't have enough for all 51 days). To keep the same general style and feel, I drew them in the same notebook with the same pens.</p>

<p>The original, unedited online logbook is still up, for those who can't afford to buy the book. If you can pay, I'd appreciate it if you could buy a copy. It helps fuel the writings of future stories and illustrations. I also wrote a small tutorial on <a href='pandoc.html'>how to use Pandoc</a> to publish e-books. If you would like my assistance in publishing a book, let me know and I'll help as best I can.</p>
