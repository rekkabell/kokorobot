<p>A variety of physical works, done for fun.</p>

<h3>Sushi chef Galeru</h3>

<p>A modded Munny (designer toy). Ears, eyebrows and fur were made of Sculpey polymer clay, body was painted with acrylic. Shoes and hat were made with a 3d printer out of PLA.</p>

<p>I baked it with a make-shift oven. We had a metal file cabinet that I outlined with foil, and pointed a room heater towards it. It worked quite well.</p>

<p>Galeru was a fictional digimon I made up, and continued to use in other non-digimon related art. In another universe, Galeru was a sushi chef. Made in 2012.</p>

<h3>Vambit paint</h3>

<p>A vambit (see <a href='drownspire.html' class='local'>drownspire</a>) custom painted with acrylic into a foo dog.</p>

<h3>Painted</h3>

<p>Was really into painting Munnies for a while, this is the second one I'd made. Made in 2009.</p>

<p>Attended Munny Bash in Montreal, and made a Munny with Devine (below).</p>

<h3>Kyoudai</h3>

<p>Kyoudai means siblings in Japanese. This is brother and sister, two sculptures that go together. Made in 2008</p>

<p>Made during a time when I liked making physical sculptures out of wooden blocks of equal size, like pixel art. I would glue the blocks together in a specific shape and paint overtop.</p>

<h3>Merveilles</h3>

<p>A character based out of the Merveilles game made by my partner Devine. Made in 2008.</p>

<p>Made using the same technique as Kyoudai, except that the blocks were stained with paint to get a lighter, more natural color.</p>

<p>I also painted some characters on a wooden board.</p>

<h3>Soap monster</h3>

<p>Devine's character the soap monster, made out of sculpey polymer clay and painted. Made in 2007.</p>

<h3>Skydoll</h3>

<p>A skydoll painting I made for the Skydoll Tribute in Montreal. The painting was displayed at La Gallerie for the event. This is the best photo I've got, sadly. I've got a better one somewhere but I've misplaced it. This was meant more as a picture of our foster cat Shiro than of the painting. He just happened to be sitting on it at the time. Shiro liked to sit by as I painted, swatting at the end of my paintbrush. It's a wonder I was able to finish the painting at all. Acrylic over a wooden board.</p>

<h3>Ruelle</h3>

<p>I donated time and painted a mural on a wall of <a href='https://laruelledhochelaga.org/' target="_blank">La Ruelle d’Hochelaga: le centre de pédiatrie sociale en communauté</a> in Montreal. I drew the outline and the local kids were going to paint it during a special day-long event. The design had to be very simple.</p>

<p>The mural consisted of kids and fish riding waves.</p>

<h3>World map</h3>

<p>A commission I did in 2010 of world map, to be displayed in <a href='http://www.garderielespetitsvoyageurs.com/notre-mission/'target='_blank'>La Garderie des Petits Voyageurs</a> in Granby, Qc.</p>
