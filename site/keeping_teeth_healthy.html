<p>I am an adult, and I am embarassed to say that I learned very late how to brush my teeth and floss correctly. I wrote this short post to share what I have learned.</p>

<p>As a kid, I had access to yearly dentist services, courtesy of my parent's dental insurance, but as soon as I was on my own I stopped going because I couldn't afford to go. My teeth were problem-free for most of my adult life, but I started having problems in my 30's.</p>

<p>I would brush my teeth once a day before bed, rinse the toothpaste away with water afterwards, and would only floss when I had something stuck in my teeth. Growing up I was taught that this was enough. In my kid mind, a cavity was the worse thing that could happen. As an adult, it never occurred to me to research how to brush my teeth. Oral health was a solved problem! What more was there to learn? Lots, apparently...</p>

<P>I went to the dentist last year because of a tooth ache, "when was your last dentist appointment?" The dentist asked me. <i>Oooh noooo...</i> I thought, I didn't want to say, it had been over... "—10 years?" I said in a muffled voice. It didn't matter if I hadn't said it though, the evidence was all over my teeth. The ache was due to a cavity on a tooth at the back of my mouth. I had 4 cavities filled on that visit.</p>

<p>That same day, the dentist told me that my gums bled easily — an early sign of gingivitis. I am glad that I caught this early, because gingivitis can evolve into periodontitis, a more serious disorder that causes gum recession, damage to soft and hard tissues, and eventually tooth loss.</p>

<p>I have since learned a lot about oral health. While reading, I found out that I wasn't brushing or flossing my teeth correctly, it was time to update my oral care routine! I try and visit the dentist once a year now, even if it's not cheap(although they'd prefer I visit every 6 months).</p>

<p>Here is how I now care for my teeth:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I <b>floss</b> my teeth right after my last meal of the day.</li>
	<li>After flossing my teeth I rinse with <b>mouthwash</b>.</li>
	<li>I <b>brush</b> my teeth <b>twice a day</b>, when I wake up, and before I go to bed. I don't rinse with water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flossing</h2>

<p>When flossing, I used to slip the floss in the gap in my teeth and pull it right out afterwards before moving on to the next gap... this wasn't the correct way to floss, I wasn't freeing accumulations near my gumline.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, I floss after my last meal of the day. Now, when flossing...</p>

<ul>
	<li>I take a long length(25-50 cm | 10-20 inches) of floss and wrap each end around my two middle fingers until I have close to 5 cm (2 inches) of floss left in-between.</li>
	<li>I curve the floss so that it wraps against the side of the tooth I am cleaning, in a sort of exagerated C-shape. I move the floss up and down gently, then invert the C-shape and clean the other tooth neighboring the one I just finished(in the same tooth gap).</li>
	<li>Everytime I move to clean a new tooth, I use a clean section of floss.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mouthwash</h2>

<p>Because my gums are currently showing signs of gingivitis, I am, for the moment(maybe not forever), using mouthwash after flossing my teeth (mouthwash isn't essential to oral health).</p>

<p>I don't use mouthwash after brushing my teeth because it washes away the fluoride(if using toothpaste with fluoride). I use an alcohol-free CPC-based mouthwash.</p>

<p>When using mouthwash, I use the amount recommended on the bottle(20 ml | 4 tsps), and swish the liquid around in my mouth for 30 seconds. I spit the liquid, but I don't rinse my mouth. I wait at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything(even water). I don't rinse it away with water because mouthwash uses ingredients — like fluoride or antiseptics — that continue to act even after I spit it out, rinsing my mouth with water washes these beneficial compounds away.</p>

<q>More brushing doesn’t automatically equate to better oral health, the quality of the brushing matters a lot.</q>

<h2>Brushings</h2>

<p>When brushing my teeth, I used to brush too hard, damaging my gums, I also brushed back and forth(not against the gumline). Now, when brushing, I go slow. Dentists recommend brushing for at least 2 minutes.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Outside of the teeth</b>. I start with the outside surfaces of my teeth. I go slow, tooth by tooth. I tilt the brush at a 45° angle, then move it in short strokes against the gumline.</li>
	<li><b>Inside of the teeth</b>. I use the same technique as with the outside of my teeth, but I go slower, trying to pay attention to each tooth. Because I can't see what tooth I am brushing it is easy to skip one..</li>
	<li><b>Top of the teeth</b>. I run the brush back and forth along the topsides of my teeth.</li>
	<li><b>Front teeth inside</b>. In the end, I like to brush the inside of my front top and lower teeth, brushing against the gumline.</li>
	<li><b>Tongue</b>. I brush my tongue.</li>
	<li><b>Rinsing</b>. I spit out the toothpaste(the one I use has fluoride), but I do not rinse it away with water. The left-over toothpaste acts as a chemical to break down germs over time. There's not enough leftover in your mouth to cause problems, but enough to protect your teeth. Wait at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few additional tips:</p>

<p><b>Don't brush your teeth right after eating</b>. Rinsing with water is fine. Brushing your teeth after a meal, especially if it's acidic, is not great because the enamel is a bit softer and it can damage your teeth. It is best to wait 30-60 minutes after brushing to avoid damaging the enamel.</p>

<p><b>In the morning, brush before breakfast, not after</b>. During sleep, plaque-causing bacteria can proliferate. Brushing just after waking up can help remove these potentially harmful oral bacteria, increase saliva production and provide a protective barrier over the tooth enamel. Those who prefer to brush after eating breakfast ought to wait 30 minutes and avoid consuming acidic foods. (Note that this advice is primarily for those who are cavity-prone, you can brush right after breakfast, but if you use toothpaste with fluoride you'll wash away all of the benefits of using it).</p>
