<p>Bulle, Tartine, Momo and other characters of the <b>Mon Ami Bulle</b> app, travel and make discoveries in unique universes. This project was contract work for the IOS app <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220626013728/https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/mon-ami-bulle/id1088076963" target="_blank">Mon ami Bulle</a> by Télé Québec. See a <a href="https://www.telequebec.tv/programmation/mon-ami-bulle" target="_blank">short video</a> about the project.</p>

<p>I worked on many assets for the animated sequences, and did the artwork for 3 of the main narrated stories of the game. The stories were my main task. The project was published in 2016, I worked on the project in 2015.</p>

<p>It was a really lovely project, made with love by an amazing team, but unfortunately the app was discontinued. I believe the animation segments are still available to watch on TV.</p>
