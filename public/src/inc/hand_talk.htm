<p>Hand Talk, or Plains Sign Talk, is a trade language that was once the lingua franca across what is now central Canada, the central and western United States and northern Mexico, used among the various Plains Nations.</p>

<p>Ben beat me to it, but all of the Hand Talk signs are documented on <a href="https://corvid.cafe/psl.html" target="lazy">Corvid Cafe</a>. I keep a local copy of the page as an offline reference. What I love about Ben's page is that it is searchable, so it is easy to look up different words.</p>

<p><i>"Sign language is so faithful to nature and so natural in its expression that it is not probable that it will ever die.  It has a practical utility, and should not be looked upon merely as a repetition of motions to be memorized from a limited list, but as a cultivated art, founded upon principles which can be readily applied by travelers. Sign language may be used to advantage at a distance, which the eye can reach but not the ear, and still more frequently when silence or secrecy is desired."</i> William Tomkins <a href='http://www.inquiry.net/outdoor/native/sign/index.htm' target='_blank'>Source</a></p>
